The Optimal Investor is a Java-based desktop application project that assists users in making the most profitable investment decisions within a given budget. By using 0/1 Knapsack Algorithm, the app provides optimal portfolio combinations based on investment costs and expected returns. 

Built with Java Swing for a light, user-friendly interface, the system allows users to input multiple investments, set a budget, and calculate the maximum return achievable. Also suggests increasing budget if it gives more profit.
